                <h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">Grow It!&apos;s goal is to help families impacted by food insecurity by increasing their accessibility to sustainable and nutritious food. We chose to create this product based on the following sustainable development goals: zero hunger and responsible consumption and production. From our research, we learned that some of the main factors leading to food insecurity are poverty, unemployment, and geography. Grow It! addressed this issue by providing detailed instructions on how to grow plants at home, how to reduce waste, and how to consume responsibly. Grow It! also offers personalized plant suggestions, community support, and access to seeds through a local seed library.</p>

                <p style="text-align: center;">The community page is a page of the website that I created. On this page, users can post about their plant journey, any problems that they have faced when growing plants, and also general comments about how Grow It! has helped them personally. Users can also comment on other posts to share knowledge and to connect with others. We decided to include a community page on the website to create a sense of togetherness for those facing food insecurity. Food insecurity can be such an isolating experience, so the community page aims to create a support system for those experiencing this issue.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                            As we designed Grow It!, accessibility was at the top of our minds. We made sure that 
                            all of the color contrasts were AAA accessible so that the text is readable. Our team also did a
                            Heuristic evaluation to find any possible usablity problems to solve throughout our iterative design process.
