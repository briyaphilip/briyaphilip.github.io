					<p>Strike a Chord is an app that aims to use music as a catalyst to foster connection.&nbsp;</p>
					<br>
					<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
					<p>Finding a meaningful connection with others is an intrinsic human need that has been increasingly harder to come by. Strike a Chord solves this problem by offering an inclusive community for music lovers and artists to create bonds through their love of music.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Goals:</h3>
					<p>-Create an app that uses music as a catalyst to foster connection</p>
					<p>-Increase access to the local music scene</p>
					<p>-Uplift local artists and provide a platform for them to advertise their services</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Team:&nbsp;</h3>
					<p>Entrepreneur, Project Manager, and Ux Designer - Me!</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Scope:</h3>
					<p>2&nbsp;months</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Tools:&nbsp;</h3>
					<p>Figma, Notion</p>
					<br>
					<h3>User Research:</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="column">
						  <img src="img/donutchart1.png" alt="chart1" style="width:100%">
						</div>
						<div class="column">
						  <img src="img/donutchart2.png" alt="chart2" style="width:100%">
						</div>
					<p>-87% of people tend to create connections based on shared music tastes.</p>
					<p>-Around 69% of people would be open to connecting with local artists and events through an app.</p>
					<p>Based on our surveys, we found that a majority of people surveyed would be open to using an app to further connect through music and expose themselves to the local music scene.</p>
					<p>Most people surveyed were in college (around ages 18-22).</p>

					<h3>Similar Apps:&nbsp;</h3>
					<p>Bands in Town, Spotify, Hinge, Ticketmaster, Eventbrite</p>
					<br>
					<h3>User Needs:</h3>
					<p>-Discovering new music/artists, learning new music skills</p>
					<p>-Advertising local events</p>
					<p>-Buying/selling merchandise</p>
					<h3>Prototype:</h3>
					
					<br>
					<h3>Results:</h3>
					<p>Designing this app accomplished our goal of creating an environment for music lovers and music artists to connect over music. The Ads page provides a space to advertise local music events as well as&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;music lessons. The Explore page allows users to expand their music taste and find new artists. By connecting to Spotify or Apple Music, the Explore page will curate a list of artists similar to their taste. This&nbsp;page provides the option to find artists completely different from their current taste, simply by flipping the switch at the top of the screen. The Feed page allows users to connect with people in their local area. By viewing other users&apos;&nbsp;top artists and top song, users can connect with each other and message, forming a basis for connection. The Shop page provides a space for people to sell music-related items such as records, band t-shirts, instruments, etc. Lastly, the profile page displays the user&apos;s information (such as top songs, top artists, etc.).</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Design Choices:</h3>
					<p>I chose to use this typeface&nbsp;because it aims to communicate the brand as easy, personal, and fun to use. The clean, 
						simple, geometric typeface is round and friendly. The use of consistent icons 
						permits a smooth and familiar user experience. Rounded icons promote a feeling 
						of comfort. Rounded corners are easier on the eyes.&nbsp;The default dark mode 
						with an orange accent is the ideal balance of color that allows the user to feel 
						stimulated and welcomed. The colors were all tested for the correct contrast and are all AAA accessible. Dark mode is also easier on the eyes.&nbsp;An app that 
						is easy to use is the most important part of the functionality. The bottom navigation bar allows for easy navigation 
						with just one thumb.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Takeaways:</h3>
					<p>One of the main takeaways from this project is that more user research could&apos;ve been conducted. In hindsight, I would&apos;ve contacted more local artists to fully understand their needs and what they would need and want in an app. I also would&apos;ve pushed back on the Shop page. I do not think this necessarily fits into the goal of the app: fostering connection through music. With the knowledge I have gained through this project and other projects, I believe that this app would be even more beneficial with only the necessary features. This was definelty a great learning experience as I continue to learn more about user experience design.</p>
